## Salary Prediction Model using Multiple Linear Regression

Welcome to the Salary Prediction Model repository! This project utilizes a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on various factors. Whether you're a job seeker aiming to negotiate your salary or a recruiter looking to determine competitive compensation packages, this model can provide valuable insights.

### Model Overview

The Salary Prediction Model employs Multiple Linear Regression, a powerful statistical technique, to predict salaries based on a combination of predictor variables. By analyzing factors such as education level, years of experience, job title, and location, the model generates predictions that align with prevailing market trends and individual qualifications.

### Data Preparation

To ensure accurate predictions, the dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including:

- Handling missing values: Imputation techniques are applied to address missing data points.
- Feature engineering: Relevant features are selected or created to enhance the model's predictive capability.
- Encoding categorical variables: String values are converted into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### Model Training and Evaluation

Once the data is preprocessed, the Multiple Linear Regression model is trained using a subset of the data. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared to assess its accuracy and predictive power.


### Usage
